This listing, currently alphabetical, represents the Microsoft people who are providing teaching, training, and instructing on the Azure Data Platform:

- George Walters (<a href="https://georgewalters.wordpress.com/">b</span></a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/gwalters69">t</span></a>)
- Dandy Weyn (<a href="https://twitter.com/ilikesql">t</span></a>)
- Buck Woody (<a href="http://www.buckwoody.com/">b</span></a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/BuckWoodyMSFT">t</span></a>)

Over time, as the list grows, I will begin to categorize. I might even rank based on my knowledge of, or reports on, the speaker.

If you think you should be on this list, issue a pull request. If you are listed, but your information needs to be updated in some fashion, same thing.
